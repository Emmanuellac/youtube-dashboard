The YouTube Analytics Dashboard is a powerful tool that provides YouTubers with in-depth insights into the performance of their YouTube channels. This dashboard is designed to help YouTubers monitor key metrics, analyze audience demographics, and optimize their content strategy for better engagement.
This project and the data used were part of a case study found here. It focuses on examining views, uploads, total revenue, and factors influencing YouTuber's efforts to gain recognition, income, and sharing of daily life activities by YouTubers.

BACKGROUND this YouTube dashboard was visualized using the Powerbi tool. It tells a data-driven story on the different categories and total revenue earned yearly by each YouTuber and its channel type. This dashboard also shows YouTuber achievements and countries with the highest subscribers.
PROBLEM STATEMENT This individual wants to use the data to answer a few questions and virtually show the trends, views, and uploads, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve made yearly, and which YouTubers are their favorites. Having this deeper connection with his subscribers will help them deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal subscribers.
